# WeaponMaster Dragon

WeaponMaster Dragon is a dragon that has special abilities. 

Difficulty Level: 6/5. Don't expect to beat this without custom gear.

It has 1,000 health. It will regenerate with end crystals and also naturally (as high as 1 health per 3 seconds when the dragon is low).

## Summoning

In addition to the four crystals, you must place 2 additional crystals within the 3x3 box around the fountain.


## Weight

Weight represents how much work you've done during the fight. Up to 1,375 weight can be dropped per fight, and it is used to determine loot.

| **Action**        | Weight | Maximum |
| --- | --- | --- |
| End Crystal       | 30     | 300 |
| Damage Dragon     | 1\*    | 1000 |
| Damager Bonus     | 75\*\* | 75 |

\* You get 1 weight for every 1 HP damage of the dragon, but your weight can decrease if the total damage is more (since only 1,000 weight can be given). For example, if you dealt 700 damage, but there was a total damage of 1400, you would only receive 500 weight, instead of 700.

\*\* Only one player can get the damager bonus if they have dealt at least 200 damage and are at least 30 damage above 2nd place.
