**WeaponMaster** is a Minecraft server plugin that adds weapons, armor, tools, and gameplay mechanics to the game.

It runs on any Spigot (or Paper and its forks, which are required for some additional features) server running Minecraft 1.21+.


## Features

- As of v1.9.0, **75** unique weapons, armor, and tools.
- The **WeaponMaster Dragon**, an upgraded dragon fight with special loot and rewards.
- The **Wither Challenge**, where you have to kill the wither without armor to get special loot.
- And some overpowered admin commands for fun.
- Performant, taking less than 0.2% of your tick (that's 0.1 ms) in most cases.
